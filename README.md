# Capstone-Intrusion-Detection

This project addresses the growing complexity of cyberattacks and the challenges in identifying breaches and ensuring computer security. It explores various intrusion detection techniques, focusing on using ToN IoT to classify different types of intrusions. To handle the dataset's high dimensionality, feature engineering techniques like PCA, ICA, CFS, MI, SFM, and FIR are employed. The study applies multiple machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, gradient boost, extreme gradient boost, Ada Boost, and multilayer perceptron to improve intrusion detection accuracy. The project offers a comprehensive evaluation of intrusion detection methods and underscores the importance of diverse machine learning models. It also discusses evasion techniques and future research challenges in enhancing computer system security against evolving cyber threats.
